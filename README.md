“In my TestNG + Rest Assured framework, I externalized the base.uri in pom.xml. 
During execution, I pass it via Maven command using -Dbase.uri. 
This way, I can easily switch between QA, UAT, and Production environments without changing code. 
My test validates the status code and ensures the response body has data.”
